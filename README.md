 # Using the app for the first time
 When you launch the app for the first time, a login screen will appear.
 The reason why i chose to impelement a login and register function for this assessment is because you can use it to save hotelFavourites and hotel property history searches accross all devices using FireBase (cloud database).
 You can either register for a new account or you can login using my credentials whcih is
 Email Address: "choclate00@live.com"
 Password: "abc123".

 # Swift Packages Used
 I have used the Firebase SDK and PromiseKit in the swift package manager to handle Cloud databases.
